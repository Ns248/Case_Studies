# 1. Data Cleaning 
Data cleaning is the process of preparing data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted. This data is usually not necessary or helpful when it comes to analyzing data because it may hinder the process or provide inaccurate results.
#  Steps to Clean Data
1. Remove Duplicate and Incomplete Cases
2. Remove Oversample
3. Ensure Answers are Formatted Correctly
4. Remove Nonsense Answers and Unreadable Data
5. Identify and Review Outliers
6. Code Open Ended Data
7. Check Data Consistency
8. Perform Final Quality Assurance Checks

# 2. Data visualization
Data visualization is the representation of data or information in a graph, chart, or other visual format. It communicates relationships of the data with images. This is important because it allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen.
# Introduction to Data Visualization in Python
1.	Matplotlib: low level, provides lots of freedom.
2.	Pandas Visualization: easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib.
3.	Seaborn: high-level interface, great default styles.
4.	ggplot: based on R's ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics.
5.	Plotly: can create interactive plots

# 3. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself.

# 4.Machine Learning Module
In Machine Learning Studio (classic), a module is a building block for creating experiments. Each module encapsulates a specific machine learning algorithm, function, or code library that can act on data in your workspace. The modules are designed to accept connections from other modules, to share and modify data.
